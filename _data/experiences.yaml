    - Working with the Head of IT to implement a new virtual environment using Dell EMC Storage, Dell Unity Fibre Channel Switches and VMWare 6.5. We re-designed the original network (All Cisco Meraki) to allow the provision of VLANs for network segregation, separating the different departments and providing a more secure environment. We built a new domain and integrated it with Azure Active Directory to make better use of the O365 Business Licences and to leverage the additional services available (Onedrive/Skype/Sharepoint/Teams/Powershell Automation). The original E-Mail solution GFI Kerio Connect was migrated to Exchange 365, making use of the increased mailbox sizes and additional redundant storage allocations for Email Archiving. Implemented DKIM/SPF/DMARC records to dramatically reduce the current levels of SPAM throughout the organisation - I monitored DMARC regularly to ensure the solution was working effectively (dmarcanalyzer.com). Performed my additional requirement of training other team members on the helpdesk whilst on-the-job when assisting with day-to-day activities where required.
    - During this time, I also spent my personal development time creating a PowerShell Module to automate future configuration of the Cisco Meraki equipment - https://github.com/BanterBoy/CiscoMeraki
